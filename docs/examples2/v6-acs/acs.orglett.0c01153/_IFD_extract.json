 "This collection is interesting because it involves two remote data resource files.",
 "It also required some special curation.",
 " - some structure were missing",
 " - protecting groups PMP and Nap uknown to ChemDraw had to be expanded manually",
 " - 3D chair cyclohexane implied stereochemistry not entirely interpretable, ",
 "   requiring only very minor tweaks -- lengthening the TBSO distance a bit, an occasional addition of H",
 " - capitalization and punctuation was inconsistent in the directory names starting with 'compound'",
 " - 'broken' Bruker directories missing their /n/ directories, for example /10/.",
 "   (This means that these directories could not be read back into TopSpin.)",
 "   IDFExtractor fixes this problem, zipping the directories up with an added /1/ subdirectory.",
 
"The collection consists of individual compound zip files with ",
   
"   Compound_10.zip|             ",
"       Compound 10/             ",
