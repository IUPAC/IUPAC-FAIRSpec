	Welcome to the GitHub project web pages for 
	<a href=https://iupac.org/projects/project-details/?project_nr=2019-031-1-024>IUPAC Project 2019-031-1-024, Development of a Standard for FAIR Data Management for Spectroscopic Data</a>. 
	At this site we highlight our development of IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aids.
	
	<H3><a name=cdx href="cdx_sdk">CDX/CDXML specification</a></H3>
	<br><br>But, first, 352 pages retrieved from multiple points on the wayBack machine 
	preserving the CDX/CDXML specification. (Note that some images were not retrievable.)
	This specification is important, as it is the basis for one of the most
	widely used and accessible formats in the chemistry community for 
	communicating structural information. The specification is detailed and 
	extensive, and has been implemented in Jmol, allowing an extractor
	to use it as a basis for creating value-added structure representations such as 
	molecular formulas, InChI strings, SMILES, and MOL-format descriptions, 
	which can be used both for display and validation. The pages are also available
	as a <a href=https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/tree/main/specs/cdx_cdxml>ZIP file</a>.

	<img width=600 src=examples/v1-demo/v1.png>
	<br><br>Our first demonstration of a very early (2021) prototypical finding aid. 
	It was generated from a set of supporting information data sets from the <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.joc.0c00248>ACS FAIRData pilot study</a> (2023).
	This demo just gave an idea of what a minimal extraction of metadata might look like in JSON format.
	<br><br>
	
	<H3><a target=_blank name=v4 href="https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/iupac/site/ifd2024/index.htm">examples/v4-acs</a></H3>
	<img width=600 src=examples/v4-acs/v4.png>
	<br><br>A more sophisticated demonstration allowing for substructure and text searching, as well as the creation of predicted spectra based on SMILES strings (2023).
	This demonstration illustrates how supporting information ZIP files in a variety of formats can be 
	extracted for metadata. 
	<br><br>
	   The page (the link above) provides substructure searching by 
	   utilizing about 400 Java classes transpiled into JavaScript using the Eclipse java2script transpiler, 
	   running the SwingJS implementation Java 8. These JavaScript (n√© Java) classes provide substructure searching for the page using SMILES strings created from MOL, CDX, and CDXML files associated with the spectra in the collection. 
    Input uses a hybrid JME (<a href=https://github.com/BobHanson/JME-SwingJS>Java Molecular Editor</a>)/OCL (<a href=https://github.com/BobHanson/OCL-SwingJS>OpenChemLib</a>) structure-drawing interface; matching is carried
    out using a small Jmol-derived smiles processing package, also transpiled to JavaScript from Java. 
    The Finding Aids are more developed but still only version 0.0.5.

	<H3><a target=_blank name=v6-acs href="examples2/v6-acs/index.htm">examples2/v6-acs</a></H3>
	<img width=600 src=examples2/v6-acs/v6.png>
    <br><br>A much richer demonstration involving advanced finding aids created using
	<a target=_blank href=https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/blob/main/src/main/java/com/integratedgraphics/test/ExtractorTestACS.java>ExtractorTestACS.java</a>.
	The extractor generates the web pages from a set of supporting information data sets from ACS FAIRData pilot study, adding the capability to 
	search for properties of compounds, strutures, and spectra. 
	This demonstration illustrates <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/blob/main/documents/specifications/IUPAC_FAIRSpec_Specification_draft.pdf>IUPAC FAIRSpec Metadata Object Model Specification, version 0.1.0</a> (2025.08.15).

	<H3><a target=_blank name=icl-10386 href="examples2/index.htm?url=https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/iupac/examples2/icl-10386/IFD.findingaid.json">examples2/index.htm?url=[path to finding aid]</a></H3>
    <img width=600 src=examples2/icl-10386/icl-10386.png>
	<br><br>This example demonstrates a generic web page loading an IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aid 
	from the URL on a different server using the ?url= query. In this case, the requested finding aid along 
	with its associated IUPAC FAIRSpec Data Collection
	 are hosted at St. Olaf College in
	<a target=_blank href=https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/iupac/examples2/icl-10386>https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/iupac/examples2/icl-10386</a>.

    <img width=600 src=examples2/icl-14635/icl-14635.png>
	<br><br>This "metadata crawler" demonstration illustrates how we 
	can take a single DOI, "10.14469/HPC/14635", and produce a 
	complete IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aid simply by following metadata stored at DataCite.
	The data set is from Imperial College London. 
	The only calls to the actual repository in creating the Finding Aid were
	to extract https HEAD information about each data item. This included preferred file name, 
	media type (such as "image/png"), and file size in bytes. 
	The program used 
	to create the IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aid was DOICrawler.java, subclassed as ICLDOICrawler 
	in order to handle a few idiocyncracies 
	of that particular repository. Though not as rich...
	
    <br><br>	
	<H3><a name=v5 href="examples/v5-icl-repository-DOI-crawl/demo_icl.htm">examples/v5-icl-repository-DOI-crawl</a></H3>
	This demonstration highlights a what can be done 
	by "crawling" of metadata-rich DataCite records. 
    <br><br>    	
	The demonstration focus on the interconnected DataCite 
	metadata records of a <a href="https://data.hpc.imperial.ac.uk/resolve/?doi=10386">highly curated collection</a> at 
	the high-performance computing repository at 
	Imperial College London. This collection contains 
	data relating to 60 compounds associated with the
	article <a href=https://doi.org/10.14469/HPC/10386>Syntheses and Characterization of Main Group, Transition Metal, Lanthanide, 
	and Actinide Complexes of Bidentate Acylpyrazolone Ligands</a>, 
	by Thomas Mies, Andrew J. P. White, Henry S. Rzepa, 
	Luciano Barluzzi, Mohit Devgan and Richard A. Layfield, 
	and Anthony G. M. Barrett.
	<br><br>
    The <a href="examples/v5-icl-repository-DOI-crawl/10.14469_hpc_10386/IFD.findingaid.json">IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aid</a> 
	accesses 323 DOI-referenced pages in the repository 
	backed by DataCite metadata records pointing to 1843 distinct digital
	items, including 390 CDXML drawings, 294 MOL files, 
	140 complete Bruker NMR datasets, 144 JCAMP-DX files,
	and 328 PNG images.  
	<br><br>
    The sample landing page for the Finding Aid 
	uses only the information in the DataCite metadata records retrieved from 
	DataCite by <a href="https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/blob/main/src/main/java/com/integratedgraphics/extractor/DOICrawler.java">DOICrawler.java</a>,
	which was initiated using only the DOI string for the main repository page, "10.14469/hpc/10386". 
	Thus, for this proof-of-concept, no files from the repository
	were actually downloaded in the creation of the Finding Aid or the 
	generation of the landing page itself.
	<br><br>
	The landing page uses <a href=https://github.com/BobHanson/JME-SwingJS>JME-SwintJS</a> 
	to create <a href=https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html>SMARTS</a> 
	substructure searches and <a href=https://github.com/BobHanson/Jmol-SwingJS>Jmol-SwingJS</a> 
	to do the SMILES-string searching. Not all compounds in this collection
	have fully validated <a href=https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html>SMILES</a> strings 
	due to the inorganic nature of the 
	compounds. But this does not prevent SMARTS searching of the metal center, ligands, or 
	associated solvents. In addition, the page provides access to 
	<a href=https://www.nmrdb.org>nmrdb</a> for optional NMR spectrum prediction.
	(You may notice some bouncing around of text while loading; this was a problem with this
	first-generation crawler landing page.) 
	<br><br>
	
    <H3><a name=v6-crawler2 href="examples2/v6-crawler2/index.htm">examples2/v6-crawler2</a></H3>
    <img width=600 src=examples2/v6-crawler2/v6c2.png>
    <br><br>This more recent demonstration combines crawling of DataCite metadata records with extraction of the files. 
    The DataCite DOI records are followed, but unlike the v5 example, here we also download all digital items 
    into a temporary directory in order to extract their metadata.
    <br><br>
    The process creates an especially metadata-rich IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aid 
    for a repository, in effect converting the repository from a FAIRSpec-ready data collection 
    to an IUPAC FAIRSpec Data Collection.
    <br><br>
    The finding aid in this case also internalizes all PNG images as dataURIs, allowing the page to 
    load and display rapidly, without directly accessing the repository itself for images.
    This creates a somewhat larger JSON document (17 MB) -- still considerably
    smaller than the 75.7 GB of data in this repository collection. 
    The landing page and associated files are completely portable. You can work with it locally
    by downloading and unzipping <a href=examples2/v6-crawler2/10.14469_hpc_10386.zip>v6-crawler2/10.14469_hpc_10386.zip</a>.

	<H3><a name=v5j href="https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/blob/main/dist">IFDExtractor.jar (beta)</a></H3>
	<br><br>This demonstration illustrates how IFDExtractor can create an IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aid and an associated example landing page from a 
	structured set of information that defines the key aspects of a data collection. 
	Now in beta testing, <a href="https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/blob/main/src/main/java/com/integratedgraphics/extractor/IFDExtractor.java">IFDExtractor.java</a> requires a small configuration file to do its job.
	We are currently working on providing a handful of templates for this file; right now
	it has to be constructed by hand for each dataset being processed.
	<br><br>
	The command line looks like this:
	<br><br>
	<code>java -jar IFDExtractor.jar IFD.extract-test.json</code>
	<br><br>
	and produces <a href="examples/IFDExtractor">this page</a>.
