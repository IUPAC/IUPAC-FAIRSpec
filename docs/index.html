Welcome to the GitHub project web pages for 
<a href=https://iupac.org/projects/project-details/?project_nr=2019-031-1-024>IUPAC Project 2019-031-1-024, Development of a Standard for FAIR Data Management for Spectroscopic Data</a>. 
At this site we highlight our development of IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aids.

<H3><a name=cdx href="cdx_sdk">CDX/CDXML specification</a></H3>
<p>But, first, 352 pages retrieved from multiple points on the wayBack machine 
preserving the CDX/CDXML specification. (Note that some images were not retrievable.)
This specification is important, as it is the basis for one of the most
widely used and accessible formats in the chemistry community for 
communicating structural information. The specification is detailed and 
extensive, and has been implemented in Jmol, allowing an extractor
to use it as a basis for creating value-added structure representations such as 
molecular formulas, InChI strings, SMILES, and MOL-format descriptions, 
which can be used both for display and validation. The pages are also available
as a <a href=https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/tree/main/specs/cdx_cdxml>ZIP file</a>.

<H3><a name=v1 href="examples/v1-demo/demo.htm">examples/v1-demo</a></H3>
<p>Our first demonstration of a prototypical finding aid (2021), 
just giving an idea of what a minimal extraction of metadata might look like in JSON format.

<H3><a name=v4 href="https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/iupac/site/ifd2024/index.htm">examples/v4-acs</a></H3>
<p>A more sophisticated demonstration involving finding aids (2023)
generated from a set of fourteen supporting information data sets from the <a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.joc.0c00248>ACS FAIRData pilot study</a> (2023). 
This demonstration illustrates how supporting information ZIP files in a variety of formats can be 
extracted for metadata.

<H3><a name=v6-acs href="examples2/v6-acs/index.htm">examples2/v6-acs</a></H3>
<p>A much richer demonstration involving finding aids (2025) created using
<a target=_blank href=https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/blob/main/src/main/java/com/integratedgraphics/test/ExtractorTestACS.java>ExtractorTestACS.java</a>.
The extractor generates the web pages from a set of fourteen supporting information data sets from ACS FAIRData pilot study. 
This demonstration illustrates <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/blob/main/documents/specifications/IUPAC_FAIRSpec_Specification_draft.pdf>IUPAC FAIRSpec Metadata Object Model Specification, version 0.1.0</a> (2025.08.15). 
<br><br>

<H3><a name=icl-10386 href="examples2/index.htm?url=https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/iupac/examples2/icl-10386/IFD.findingaid.json">examples2/index.htm?url=[path to finding aid]</a></H3>
<p>This example demonstrates a generic web page loading an IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aid 
from the URL using the ?url= query. In this case, the requested finding aid along with its associated IUPAC FAIRSpec Data Collection
 are in  
<a target=_blank href=https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/iupac/examples2/icl-10386>https://chemapps.stolaf.edu/iupac/examples2/icl-10386</a>.

<br><br>

<H3><a name=icl-14635 href="examples2/icl-14635/index.htm">examples/examples2/icl-14635</a></H3>
<p>This "metadata crawler" demonstration illustrates how we 
can take a single DOI, "    ", and produce a complete
IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aid simply by following metadata at DataCite.
The data set is from Imperial College London. 
The only calls to the actual repository in creating the Finding Aid were
to extract http HEAD information about each data item. This included preferred file name, 
media type (such as "image/png"), and number of bytes. The program used 
to create the IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aid was DOICrawler.java, subclassed as ICLDOICrawler in order to handle a few idiocyncracies 
of that repository. 
<br><br>
The resultant landing page (the link above) utilizes about 400 Java classes 
transpiled into JavaScript using the Eclipse java2script transpiler, running the SwingJS implementation
of Java 8. These JavaScript (n√© Java) classes provide substructure searching for the page. 
Input uses a hybrid JME (Java Molecular Editor)/OCL (OpenChemLib) structure-drawing interface; matching is carried
out using a small Jmol-derived smiles processing package, also transpiled to JavaScript from Java.

<H3><a name=v5 href="examples/v5-icl-repository-DOI-crawl/demo_icl.htm">examples/v5-icl-repository-DOI-crawl</a></H3>
<p>This demonstration highlights a what can be done 
by "crawling" of DataCite metadata records as well as the searching of compounds using substructure searches. 

The demonstration focus on the interconnected DataCite 
metadata records of a <a href="https://data.hpc.imperial.ac.uk/resolve/?doi=10386">highly curated collection</a> at 
the high-performance computing repository at 
Imperial College London. This collection contains 
data relating to 60 compounds associated with the
article <a href=https://doi.org/10.14469/HPC/10386>Syntheses and Characterization of Main Group, Transition Metal, Lanthanide, 
and Actinide Complexes of Bidentate Acylpyrazolone Ligands</a>, 
by Thomas Mies, Andrew J. P. White, Henry S. Rzepa, 
Luciano Barluzzi, Mohit Devgan and Richard A. Layfield, 
and Anthony G. M. Barrett.
<p>
The <a href="examples/v5-icl-repository-DOI-crawl/10.14469_hpc_10386/IFD.findingaid.json">IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aid</a> 
accesses 323 DOI-referenced pages in the repository 
backed by DataCite metadata records pointing to 1843 distinct digital
items, including 390 CDXML drawings, 294 MOL files, 
140 complete Bruker NMR datasets, 144 JCAMP-DX files,
and 328 PNG images.  
<p>
The sample landing page
for the Finding Aid 
uses only the information in the DataCite metadata records retrieved from 
DataCite by <a href="https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/blob/main/src/main/java/com/integratedgraphics/extractor/DOICrawler.java">DOICrawler.java</a>,
which was initiated using only the DOI string for the main repository page, "10.14469/hpc/10386". 
Thus, for this proof-of-concept, no files from the repository
were actually downloaded in the creation of the Finding Aid or the 
generation of the landing page itself.

<p>The landing page uses <a href=https://jsme-editor.github.io>JSME</a> 
to create <a href=https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html>SMARTS</a> 
substructure searches and <a href=https://sourceforge.net/projects/jmol>JSmol</a> 
to do the SMILES-string searching. Not all compounds in this collection
have fully validated <a href=https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smiles.html>SMILES</a> strings due to the inorganic nature of the 
compounds. But this does not prevent SMARTS searching of the metal center, ligands, or 
associated solvents. In addition, the page provides access to 
<a href=https://www.nmrdb.org>nmrdb</a> for optional NMR spectrum prediction.

<H3><a name=v5j href="https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/blob/main/dist">IFDExtractor.jar (beta)</a></H3>
<p>This demonstration illustrates how IFDExtractor can create an IUPAC FAIRSpec Finding Aid and an associated example landing page from a 
structured set of information that defines the key aspects of a data collection. 
Now in beta testing, <a href="https://github.com/IUPAC/IUPAC-FAIRSpec/blob/main/src/main/java/com/integratedgraphics/extractor/IFDExtractor.java">IFDExtractor.java</a> requires a small configuration file to do its job.
We are currently working on providing a handful of templates for this file; right now
it has to be constructed by hand for each dataset being processed.
<p>
The command line looks like this:
<p>
<code>java -jar IFDExtractor.jar IFD.extract-test.json</code>
<p>
and produces <a href="examples/IFDExtractor">this page</a>.
